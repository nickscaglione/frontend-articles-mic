Welcome to my frontend dev test, built on vanilla React.js.

### Install and run

- Navigate to the root directory '/scaglione-nick-frontend-articles-mic' and install dependencies with 'npm install'

- Start up the server with 'npm start', and navigate to the corresponding port in your browser ('npm start' should open with your default browser automatically)

### Usage

- Hopefully intuitive enough to omit this section!
